# atlantis_tools_data_processing
Misc. scripts I have developed to process data from Atlantis

R_example_Atlantis_spatialmaps_predatordistribution_against_preycomposition.R
(needs the following source - R_tools_from_ReactiveAtlantis.R)
- This script is for making a map the shows the spatial distribution of a predator group at time step t, against the polygon-specific pie charts showing the prey biomass composition.

- I wanted to eventually make the image display the diet interactions, but I just never got around to it yet
